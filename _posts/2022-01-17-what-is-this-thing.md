...and how do I use it?

---

Hello!  
I'm Murdo Maclachlan, an aspiring author and Software Engineering student from Scotland, and back in September 2021, I created my [website](https://murdomaclachlan.github.io/website/) and optimistically added a page called `blog.html`. This page was completely empty save for two lines of text, aligned to the centre of the page:

> There's nothing here yet.
>
> The blog is hopefully coming soon.

Well, if 4 months is soon, then I've kept my promise because here we are! A new year, a new blog.

My first real blog, in fact, and as such, I've no real idea what to do with it. I know that at the time of creating that page I certainly didn't expect it to be on an external site, but after messing around with JavaScript for slightly too long, I gave up and went searching for a good, free, open-source blog site, and so here I am.

I think I'll probably end up creating a few secondary blogs on this account and linking to them *somewhere hopefully easy to find*.

See, I also spent a lot of today searching around for places to publish writing online -- I've [been on AllPoetry](https://allpoetry.com/Murdo_Maclachlan) for ages, and that site is fantastic, but my main aspiration has always been prose, and I'd like to get some out there so I can start receiving feedback. I've got an idea for a serialised, episodic story that would fit well with a blog, so perhaps that would go well on a secondary blog here.

Of course, if that does happen -- and it's an if for now, because university is starting again soon -- then it will also be published on at least one other site. So far I can't choose between Inkitt and Sweek, so I've got accounts on them both (see the post footer for links). I'll probably settle for one and delete the other, then get writing.

If you're interested in what I intend to write, it's high fantasy, called "A Shadow over Ersora", and I'm currently making the map for Ersora. I was only working on it for about 10 minutes when I realised it was looking a bit like Norway -- or as a friend named it, and I have to agree, "Spicy Norway".

Anyway, those are my plans for this blog for now. I might also add a secondary blog for non-writing related thoughts, but this central one will probably be reserved primarily for things related to writing and worldbuilding. Who knows how regular or irregular posts on here will even be. I certainly don't.

But, for now, I'm getting tired, as it's past midnight, so I'm going to sign off now.

If you did indeed read to this point, thank you, and have a nice night or day, wherever you are in the world!

\- Murdo
