I suppose I should probably use it; after all, I've got something to talk about for once.

Back in 2018, which though hard to believe is about three and a half years ago now, [I joined](https://allpoetry.com/Murdo_Maclachlan) a wonderful website called AllPoetry.com, and I can confidently say that back then I was a complete newbie to writing poetry. I joined in the first of October and set about writing 31 creepy poems for Hallowe'en â€• good fun, and something I yearn to replicate each year, if only I could find time these days.

But the problem with forcing oneself to write in such quantity is that the quality will suffer. My Hallowe'en 2018 poems were, uh, *all right*, by my current standards. But when I look back on my old works I do find I spend more time considering how I could improve them than I do enjoying the ride, and that's kindled a nagging desire in the back of my mind.

Often I treat poems like events, something I write until I think it good and then publish and move on, and you know, that works to an extent. I don't linger too long on things I can't quite get to work, and I've yet to have to deal with writer's block.

But writing isn't an event. Writing is a journey that never finds its rest, and I have no doubt that one day I'll look back on all I've written and think it rubbish. And there are a lot of issues with my old poems. A lot of ways they could be better. I've improved over the years, I like to think more than a little, so I decided it was time to revisit Hallowe'en 2018.

So I've rewritten all 31 of them. In one or two I only changed some punctuation, but in others I changed or added whole stanzas, or altered the direction of the poem altogether, and I think in each case improved upon my previous work.

I haven't published these poems to AllPoetry; I don't want to overwrite the original versions, because I like to be able to compare, look back and see what's changed, and I certainly don't want to spam my profile with 31 new versions of poems from years back.

So instead, I've published a collection to [my Belletristica account](https://belletristica.com/en/users/14865-murdo-maclachlan#profile), and I present to you, **[Hallowe'en 2018, Rewritten](https://belletristica.com/en/books/44015-hallowe-en-2018-rewritten/)**:

I hope you take the time to read some of the poems, and I hope you enjoy them, or at least enjoy one of them, because I definitely enjoyed this little meander down a road to the past and resetting my old thoughts in new ink.

And if you did indeed read to this point in the post, thank you, and have a nice night or day, wherever you are in the world! Until next time, I wish you all well.
