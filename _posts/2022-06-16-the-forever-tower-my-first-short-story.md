## Realising I love short stories

In the past I've never been one for short stories. And by that I mean I didn't read them much, not that I didn't like them. Those I have read I loved, for the most part. But what I'd never really done in the past was write them.

I'm someone who likes a wide variety of stories, but one thing I really like them to be is long. I like grand, sweeping tales with a multitude of subplots that all intertwine, where events in one character's story have wide-reaching and long-lasting ripples that affect the other characters in ways you don't expect. This is the sort of thing you can't get in a short story, unless you write lots of short stories focused on the same world and characters, and at that point you've just written a novel.

So when I look for fiction to read, I tend to see short stories with interesting premises and think, 'That looks interesting,' and then go for the novel next to them. I'll need to change that habit, because in writing my first short story, I've discovered I absolutely love them.

There's something very freeing about writing something shorter. I find when I set out to write a novel, sometimes I have trouble working out exactly how I get from point A to B, beginning to end; I know the broad strokes, but how to set out the journey between them can be a complex process that I often struggle with. In a short story, the journey is much shorter; in some ways the broad strokes *are* the journey, so it's much easier to just get writing. I find I write more quickly with them, and I find I work a surprising degree of detail and density into the pages I do put to paper.

## The birth of the Forever Tower

In that, I think the short story I recently completed ― and really the intended topic of this post; I'm very good at getting sidetracked ― is actually one of my best pieces of writing to date. It began as a single-part, almost flash fiction narrative I wrote in a couple of hours after seeing a monochrome picture of a courtyard inside an apartment block; neither the top nor bottom of the courtyard were visible, just three of the four walls, and it looked as though they could stretch on forever in both directions, up into light, and down into shadow. A forever tower.

That brought to me visions of an infinite world, where colour and dreams were a distant concept, where all anyone ever did was climb up towards the light without knowing why or how, never daring to turn back; where staying in one place was the worst thing you could do. I tried to imagine the life of someone in that tower. When every day was the exact same, what would they think about? How would their musings meander to conjure even the slightest variety into their lives and make them just a bit liveable?

So I wrote it and I thought it was quite good and I shelved it. Then I [joined RoyalRoad](https://www.royalroad.com/profile/296119), because I wanted to write web fiction, and, while [Belletristica is fantastic](https://belletristica.com/en/users/14865-murdo-maclachlan#profile), it isn't very popular, so there's a lot less visibility there. But upon spontaneous creation of my RoyalRoad account, I realised I didn't know what I actually wanted to publish there. I have many work-in-progress novels and novellas, but none I think are in a good enough spot to share.

Then I remembered my little story from a week or so ago: *The Forever Tower*. So I went back to it and looked it over and thought it might do with some touching up, maybe a small extension. The idea came to me to write an anthology, set in a world of drear motonony and from the viewpoints of the downtrodden and hopeless inhabitants of a labyrinth of desolations, tiny yet infinite pocket dimensions I named the *[Rooms of the Desolate](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/56312/rooms-of-the-desolate)*. Once I started polishing *The Forever Tower* for publication, I... well, let's say I got carried away.

One part grew long and turned into two. Two parts became three, and a more complete story was born. I knew where I wanted to go. I had plans beyond this one story, but it was still a short story of its own, still easier to write than a chapter of a novel. In the end, the story drew out to six parts, each roughly a thousand to one-and-a-half thousand words, and now that it's complete it's probably the piece of writing I'm thus far most satisfied with. And I've discovered I can write short stories quite quickly and still love what I produce; that's a great feeling.

## Where from here?

*The Forever Tower* is published online, completely for free, as the first entry of the *Rooms of the Desolate* collection, on [RoyalRoad](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/56312/rooms-of-the-desolate/chapter/944848/the-forever-tower-part-1) and [Belletristica](https://belletristica.com/en/books/45781-rooms-of-the-desolate/chapter/245914-the-forever-tower-part-1). It would mean a lot to me if you gave even just the first part a quick read.

Looking to the future, I have more stories for *Rooms of the Desolate* planned; in fact I've already started writing the second entry. I've given it the working title *Production Line* and am already thoroughly enjoying where it's leading me. I think the Desolate is a bit bonkers, a bit depressing, and a bit fascinating. Even as I write, I'm discovering new things about its world(s).

If you've by chance somehow stumbled upon this blog and this post and are still reading, then that's a miracle and I'm extremely happy to have held your interest this long ― perhaps I could hold it just a little longer? There's an RSS feed you can subscribe to in order to get updates to the blog, or if you prefer, you could just bookmark the site. I'll be posting here when I have news on *Rooms of the Desolate*.
